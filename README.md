#Jade + Stylus + Gulp (with a little PostCSS thrown in for good measure)

As a front-end developer who dabbles in Python, I love whitespace-dependent code. So I made a workflow that's reliant on it. 

This is constantly in flux, as I'm still trying to get it perfect. 

Why not use CoffeScript? Good question.
